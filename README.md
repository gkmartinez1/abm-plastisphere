# abm-plastisphere
abm-plastisphere is an agent-based model of the plastisphere, created and used for my senior thesis.

## How to use it?
1. Install Python
2. Run the file 'abm-final.py'. Make sure you have pycxsimulator.py, which is found in [PyCX](https://github.com/hsayama/PyCX).
3. For a model with plots, run the file 'abm-plastisphere.py'.
